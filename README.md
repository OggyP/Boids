This is a boids project made in C++ using SFML by OggyP. It is not that good, I was just trying to test my C++ skills. IDK how to run this on windows unless you compile it yourself.
To compile my project make sure you have SFML installed. Then run make. There should a binary in the /bin folder which you can run.
